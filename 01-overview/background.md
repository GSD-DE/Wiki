# Background & Context

This project stems from direct experiences working within AIM (Applied Innovation and Modernization) at the Government of Alberta and observing consistent patterns across government innovation teams.

## The Environment We Work In

### Team Capabilities
Government innovation teams across Alberta share several strengths:
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Teams excel at building UI elements, dashboards, and prototypes quickly
- **Technical Competence**: Most team members have reasonable technical backgrounds
- **Problem Identification**: Strong ability to identify real problems worth solving
- **User Experience Focus**: Good understanding of user needs and interface design

### Consistent Pain Points
However, every team encounters the same challenges:
- **Backend Struggles**: Difficulty implementing functional backend systems
- **Deployment Bottlenecks**: Major obstacles in moving from prototype to production
- **Integration Challenges**: Problems connecting with existing government systems
- **Security Compliance**: Navigating cybersecurity requirements for deployment

## The "90% Problem"

As our boss Zoran put it:

> *"We keep building houses and then once we get to the end of the construction and all we need to do is put the floorboards on, we end up stopping all construction then going and starting and building a new house. We have this neighborhood full of houses that are like 90 percent complete and they just need the floorboards on them but we just keep building new houses instead."*

This metaphor perfectly captures the core challenge: **excellent initial development that consistently stalls before deployment.**

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. Technical Debt in Legacy Systems
- Complex integration requirements with existing government infrastructure
- Unclear documentation for internal APIs and systems
- Inconsistent patterns across different ministry implementations

### 2. Deployment Complexity
- Azure deployment requires specialized knowledge
- Security compliance processes are unclear or burdensome
- Single sign-on integration is complex and poorly documented

### 3. Knowledge Silos
- Each team reinvents solutions for the same problems
- Best practices aren't shared between ministries
- Successful deployment patterns aren't documented or reusable

### 4. Resource Misallocation
- Teams spend time on repetitive infrastructure work
- Subject matter experts get pulled into basic setup tasks
- Innovation work gets delayed by technical debt

## The Vision That Emerged

Recognizing these patterns led to a clear vision: **What if we could leverage our team's strengths (rapid prototyping, problem identification) while systematically addressing our weaknesses (backend integration, deployment)?**

This insight sparked the development of GSD-DE as a system that:
- **Amplifies Strengths**: Makes idea-to-prototype even faster with AI assistance
- **Addresses Weaknesses**: Provides consistent, reusable backend and deployment patterns
- **Scales Knowledge**: Captures and shares successful patterns across teams
- **Focuses Talent**: Lets teams work on valuable problems instead of repetitive setup

## Government Context Considerations

### Security First
Government systems must prioritize security and compliance:
- All solutions must meet cybersecurity standards
- Audit trails are essential
- Single sign-on integration is mandatory
- Data handling must comply with privacy regulations

### Cross-Ministry Collaboration
The system must work across different government departments:
- Consistent patterns reduce learning curves
- Shared templates eliminate duplication of effort
- Centralized knowledge sharing improves overall capability
- Resource sharing maximizes impact

### Public Value Focus
Every innovation should demonstrate clear public benefit:
- Measurable impact on citizen services
- Cost savings or efficiency improvements
- Improved accessibility or user experience
- Alignment with government strategic priorities
