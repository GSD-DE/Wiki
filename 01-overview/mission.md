# Mission & Vision

## Vision Statement

**To transform Alberta's government innovation from a collection of unfinished prototypes into a systematic engine for deployed public value.**

We envision a future where every valuable idea from government teams has a clear, achievable path to production deployment, where technical complexity never prevents good solutions from reaching citizens, and where innovation effort translates directly into public benefit.

## Mission Statement

**GSD-DE empowers Alberta's government innovation teams to consistently deliver deployed applications by combining AI-powered assessment, automated scaffolding, and proven deployment patterns.**

We eliminate the systematic barriers that prevent promising prototypes from reaching production, enabling teams to focus on solving real problems instead of wrestling with infrastructure complexity.

## Core Values

### 1. Deployment Over Prototypes
**"Finished is better than perfect"**
- We prioritize deployed solutions over impressive demos
- Value is only created when citizens can actually use the solution
- Every project should have a clear path from idea to production

### 2. Systematic Over Ad-Hoc
**"Build once, reuse everywhere"**
- Capture and share successful patterns instead of reinventing solutions
- Create systematic approaches that scale across teams and ministries
- Eliminate duplicate effort through intelligent automation

### 3. AI-Augmented Human Expertise
**"Amplify human capability, don't replace it"**
- Use AI to handle repetitive tasks so humans can focus on valuable work
- Combine AI efficiency with human judgment and creativity
- Maintain human oversight on all critical decisions

### 4. Public Value Focus
**"Every innovation must serve Albertans"**
- Measure success by citizen benefit, not internal metrics
- Prioritize solutions with clear public value and measurable impact
- Align all technical decisions with government strategic priorities

### 5. Security and Compliance by Design
**"Build trust through systematic security"**
- Embed security and compliance into every template and process
- Make it easier to do the right thing than to take shortcuts
- Maintain audit trails and transparency in all system operations

## Strategic Objectives

### Near-Term Goals (6-12 months)
1. **Prove the Model**: Demonstrate successful end-to-end deployment of 5-10 applications
2. **Build Team Confidence**: Show teams that deployment is achievable and repeatable
3. **Capture Best Practices**: Document and systematize successful deployment patterns
4. **Scale Within AIM**: Expand usage across all AIM teams and projects

### Medium-Term Goals (1-2 years)
1. **Cross-Ministry Adoption**: Deploy GSD-DE across multiple government ministries
2. **AI Development Integration**: Implement automated code generation with human oversight
3. **Legacy System Integration**: Create connectors for major government systems
4. **Performance Optimization**: Achieve sub-24-hour turnaround for simple applications

### Long-Term Vision (2-5 years)
1. **Government-Wide Standard**: Become the default platform for government innovation projects
2. **Citizen Service Integration**: Direct integration with public-facing service portals
3. **Predictive Innovation**: Use data analytics to suggest high-impact innovation opportunities
4. **Knowledge Export**: Share successful patterns with other government jurisdictions

## Success Metrics

### Deployment Success
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of started projects that reach production deployment
- **Time to Deployment**: Average time from idea submission to live application
- **Quality Metrics**: Security compliance rate, performance standards, user satisfaction

### Resource Optimization
- **Development Efficiency**: Reduction in repetitive infrastructure work
- **Knowledge Reuse**: Number of projects using shared templates and patterns
- **Talent Allocation**: Percentage of developer time spent on innovation vs. setup

### Public Value Creation
- **Cost Savings**: Documented efficiency improvements and cost reductions
- **Service Improvements**: Measurable enhancements to citizen services
- **Innovation Volume**: Number of successful innovations deployed per year

### Organizational Learning
- **Pattern Capture**: Number of reusable patterns documented and shared
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Projects involving multiple teams or ministries
- **Skills Development**: Team members gaining deployment and cloud infrastructure skills

## Principles for Decision Making

### When Evaluating New Features
1. **Does it increase deployment success rate?**
2. **Does it reduce repetitive work for teams?**
3. **Does it improve security or compliance?**
4. **Does it scale across multiple teams/ministries?**
5. **Does it create measurable public value?**

### When Prioritizing Work
1. **Deployment blockers get highest priority**
2. **Features that help multiple teams ranked above single-team benefits**
3. **Security and compliance issues are never deferred**
4. **User experience improvements for government teams are important**
5. **Innovation that doesn't lead to deployment is discouraged**

### When Making Technical Choices
1. **Proven patterns over cutting-edge technology**
2. **Government security requirements are non-negotiable**
3. **Simplicity and maintainability over feature richness**
4. **Azure-native solutions preferred for compliance and support**
5. **Open source and vendor independence where possible**

## Cultural Change Goals

### From Individual Heroics to Systematic Excellence
- Move from "this developer can deploy anything" to "any developer can deploy using our system"
- Replace tribal knowledge with documented, automated processes
- Eliminate single points of failure in deployment capabilities

### From Project-Centric to Pattern-Centric Thinking
- Focus on building reusable solutions, not one-off projects
- Measure success by how many future projects benefit from current work
- Prioritize architectural decisions that enable multiple use cases

### From Risk Aversion to Calculated Risk-Taking
- Build confidence through proven deployment patterns
- Enable teams to attempt more ambitious projects by reducing deployment risk
- Create feedback loops that help teams learn from both successes and failures

## Alignment with Government Priorities

### Digital Government Strategy
- Supports digital-first service delivery
- Enables rapid response to changing citizen needs
- Improves government efficiency and effectiveness

### Innovation and Economic Development
- Demonstrates government leadership in AI and automation
- Creates reusable patterns that could benefit other jurisdictions
- Attracts and retains technical talent in government service

### Public Trust and Transparency
- Ensures all solutions meet security and privacy standards
- Provides clear audit trails and accountability mechanisms
- Delivers measurable public value from innovation investments
