# What is GSD-DE?

**GSD-DE** stands for "Get Stuff Done â€“ Delegate and Execute." It is a comprehensive AI-powered toolchain and automation layer designed to bridge the gap between government innovation ideas and deployed applications.

## Core Philosophy

GSD-DE operates on a fundamental principle: **Visual Flexibility with Backend Rigidity**

| Layer | Approach | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **UI/UX** | âœ… Maximum Flexibility | Each app has unique user needs and workflows |
| **Authentication** | ðŸ”’ Rigid Standards | Security compliance is non-negotiable |
| **Azure Integration** | ðŸ”’ Rigid Standards | Consistent deployment patterns reduce complexity |
| **Security** | ðŸ”’ Rigid Standards | Government security requirements must be met |

This approach allows teams to innovate freely on user experience while ensuring backend consistency, security compliance, and deployment reliability.
