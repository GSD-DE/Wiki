# GSD Wiki

Welcome to the **GSD (Government Special Delivery)** Wiki. This comprehensive documentation covers everything from system overview to deployment strategies for Alberta's government innovation task management system.

## 🎯 What is GSD?

GSD is an AI-powered task management system designed specifically for Alberta's government innovation teams. It transforms how we go from idea to deployed solution by leveraging artificial intelligence for triage, automated scaffolding, and deployment pipeline integration.

## 🎵 The Story Behind GSD-DE

> *"We keep building houses to 90% completion, but stop before putting the floorboards on. We have this neighborhood full of houses that are like 90 percent complete and they just need the floorboards on them but we just keep building new houses instead."* — Zoran

GSD was born from recognizing this pattern in government innovation: excellent prototypes that never reach deployment. This system bridges that gap.
