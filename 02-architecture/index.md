## Quick Architecture Summary

GSD-DE is built on a **modular, AI-augmented architecture** that prioritizes:

### Core Design Philosophy
- **Visual Flexibility, Backend Rigidity**: UI/UX freedom with standardized backend patterns
- **AI-First Approach**: AI integrated at every layer for intelligence and automation
- **Government-Scale Security**: Enterprise-grade security and compliance by design
- **Microservices Pattern**: Modular, maintainable, and scalable component architecture

### Technology Stack Overview

**Frontend Layer**
- Vanilla JavaScript with modular component architecture
- HTML5 with progressive enhancement
- CSS3 with Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections

**Backend Layer**
- Node.js/Express.js for high-performance API services
- SQLite for rapid development, PostgreSQL for production
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation
- Event-driven architecture for real-time features

**AI & ML Layer**
- OpenAI GPT models for natural language processing
- Local H100 GPU compute for government-controlled AI
- ZAI/GLM integration for advanced reasoning
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI system coordination

**Infrastructure Layer**
- Azure-native deployment with government compliance
- Docker containerization for consistent environments  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline automation
- Azure Key Vault for secure secrets management

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Monorepo with Microservice Deployment**: Single codebase for easier development, multiple services for production scaling
2. **Event-Driven AI Integration**: AI services operate asynchronously to maintain system responsiveness
3. **Template-First Development**: All new projects start from proven architectural patterns
4. **Security-by-Design**: Every component includes security controls from initial development
