## Understanding the GSD-DE Process

### The Journey from Idea to Impact

```
üìù SUBMIT ‚Üí ü§ñ AI ASSESS ‚Üí üë• REVIEW ‚Üí üî® BUILD ‚Üí üöÄ DEPLOY ‚Üí üìà MEASURE
```

**1. Idea Submission (5-10 minutes)**
- Describe your problem and proposed solution
- Answer guided questions about impact and users
- Submit for AI evaluation

**2. AI Assessment (2-48 hours)**
- System evaluates using RAPID framework
- Generates implementation plan and resource estimates
- May ask follow-up questions for clarity

**3. Human Review (1-5 days)**
- Development team reviews AI recommendations
- Decides whether to proceed with development
- Refines scope and timeline if approved

**4. Development & Building (2-12 weeks)**
- Team uses AI-generated plans and templates
- Builds application with automated testing
- Follows government security and compliance standards

**5. Deployment (Hours to days)**
- Automated deployment to Azure government cloud
- Integration with government SSO and systems
- Monitoring and health checks activated

**6. Impact Measurement (Ongoing)**
- Track usage, savings, and citizen satisfaction
- Monitor system performance and reliability
- Plan improvements and scaling

## Key Concepts

### RAPID Scoring Framework

Every idea is evaluated using five dimensions:

**R - ROI Potential (0-100)**
- How much money/time will this save?
- Example: Automating a manual process that takes 2 hours per case

**A - Achievability (0-100)**  
- Can we build this with available resources and skills?
- Example: Simple web form vs. complex AI system

**P - Public Value (0-100)**
- How many citizens or staff will benefit?
- Example: Service used by all Alberta drivers vs. single department

**I - Innovation Level (0-100)**
- How novel and transformative is this approach?
- Example: First-ever digital service vs. digitizing existing process

**D - Delivery Speed (0-100)**
- How quickly can we implement and show results?
- Example: Simple dashboard vs. complex integration project

### Template-Driven Development

Instead of building from scratch, GSD-DE provides:

**Frontend Templates**
- Government-styled web applications
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Bilingual support (English/French)

**Backend Templates**  
- Secure API frameworks
- Database integration patterns
- Authentication and authorization
- Audit logging and compliance

**Deployment Templates**
- Azure infrastructure as code
- CI/CD pipelines with security scanning
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Backup and disaster recovery

### AI-Augmented Workflows

AI helps with:
- **Assessment**: Evaluating feasibility and impact
- **Planning**: Creating detailed implementation strategies  
- **Development**: Generating code and documentation
- **Testing**: Creating test cases and quality checks
- **Deployment**: Automating infrastructure and monitoring

Humans control:
- **Final Decisions**: Approval and go/no-go choices
- **Quality Review**: Code review and testing oversight
- **Strategic Direction**: Priority setting and resource allocation
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Managing relationships and expectations

## Your First Project

### For Idea Submitters

**Choose a Good Starting Idea:**
- ‚úÖ Clear problem that affects multiple people
- ‚úÖ Existing manual process that could be automated
- ‚úÖ Service that citizens currently struggle with
- ‚úÖ Data that could be better organized or accessible

**Avoid These for First Projects:**
- ‚ùå Vague improvements ("make things better")
- ‚ùå Complex integrations with many legacy systems
- ‚ùå Projects requiring major policy changes
- ‚ùå Solutions without clear user benefits

**Example Good First Ideas:**
- "Automate the building permit application status updates"
- "Create a simple dashboard for tracking budget spending"
- "Build a form for citizens to report road maintenance issues"
- "Digitize the equipment checkout process for field staff"

### For Development Teams

**Start With These Activities:**
1. **Explore the Dashboard**: Familiarize yourself with the interface
2. **Review Sample Projects**: Look at completed projects for examples
3. **Browse Templates**: Understand available starting points
4. **Test AI Assessment**: Try evaluating a simple idea
5. **Practice Deployment**: Use a template to deploy a simple app

**Key Skills to Develop:**
- Understanding AI assessment results and recommendations
- Applying and customizing templates effectively
- Using Azure deployment tools and monitoring
- Government security and compliance requirements
- Working with GitHub repositories and CI/CD pipelines

## Common Questions

### "How is this different from what we do now?"

**Traditional Approach:**
- Start from scratch for each project
- Spend months on infrastructure setup
- Struggle with deployment and security compliance
- Many projects never reach production

**GSD-DE Approach:**
- Start with proven templates and patterns

- Security and compliance built-in by default
- Clear path to deployment for every approved project

### "What if the AI assessment is wrong?"

- AI provides recommendations, humans make decisions
- You can override or modify any AI suggestions
- Development teams review all assessments before proceeding
- Templates and deployment paths work regardless of AI accuracy

### "How do we ensure security and compliance?"

- All templates include government security standards
- Automated security scanning in every deployment
- Compliance checking built into development workflow  
- Audit trails for all system actions and decisions

### "What about existing systems and data?"

- Templates include common integration patterns
- Connectors available for major government systems
- Data migration tools and guidance provided
- Legacy system expertise available for complex integrations

### "How long does the whole process take?"

**Simple Applications (forms, dashboards):**
- Assessment: 2-24 hours
- Development: 2-6 weeks  
- Deployment: 1-3 days
- **Total: 3-7 weeks**

**Complex Applications (integrations, workflows):**
- Assessment: 1-3 days
- Development: 6-16 weeks
- Deployment: 1-2 weeks  
- **Total: 8-20 weeks**

**Traditional Government IT:**
