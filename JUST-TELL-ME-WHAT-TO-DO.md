## üö® 5 Steps to Get Your Government Project Built

*For government teams who need to get stuff done without reading 150,000 words of documentation*

---

### Step 1: **Submit Your Idea Properly (Don't Half-Ass This)**

```
Go to: https://goa-cc-aim-gsd-de-app.azurewebsites.net
Click: "Submit Your Idea"
```

**Fill out EVERYTHING:**
- **Title**: Be specific ("Automate permit status updates" not "make permits better")
- **Description**: Explain the EXACT problem and who it affects
- **Current Process**: What sucks about how it works now?
- **Proposed Solution**: What do you want built?

**‚ö†Ô∏è The AI will reject vague ideas. Be specific or waste everyone's time.**

---

### Step 2: **Wait for AI Assessment (Don't Bug People)**

**The AI will:**
- Score your idea using RAPID framework (0-100)
- Ask follow-up questions if your idea is unclear
- Generate implementation plan if it's good
- Reject it if it's terrible

**What scores mean:**
- **80+**: High priority, will probably get built
- **60-79**: Medium priority, might get built
- **40-59**: Low priority, probably won't get built
- **<40**: Bad idea, won't get built

**üîÑ If AI asks questions, ANSWER THEM. Don't ignore.**

---

### Step 3: **Work With the Development Team (Don't Be Annoying)**

**If your idea scores 60+:**
- Development team will contact you
- They'll review the AI's implementation plan
- They'll ask clarifying questions (ANSWER THEM)
- They'll show you mockups/prototypes

**Your job:**
- **Be available** for questions (don't disappear for 3 weeks)
- **Test early versions** and give feedback
- **Provide realistic data** for testing
- **Don't change requirements** every meeting

**üõ°Ô∏è Don't be that person:**
- "Can we add just one more feature?" (No)
- "This should be easy to change" (It's not)
- "Why is this taking so long?" (Government compliance)

---

### Step 4: **Test and Launch (Don't Skip User Testing)**

**Development team will:**
- Build your application using government templates
- Deploy to staging environment for testing
- Set up security compliance and SSO
- Create user documentation

**You need to:**
- **Test thoroughly** on staging environment
- **Train your users** before go-live
- **Plan change management** (people hate new systems)
- **Provide feedback** on bugs and issues

**üö´ Don't:**
- Demand production launch without testing
- Skip user training (users will hate you)
- Ignore security requirements (compliance team will stop you)

---

### Step 5: **Go Live and Don't Disappear (Support Your Users)**

**After production launch:**
- **Monitor usage** in the first few weeks
- **Collect user feedback** and report issues
- **Document actual impact** (cost savings, time saved, etc.)
- **Plan future improvements** based on real usage

**Track success:**
- How many people are actually using it?
- Is it solving the problem you identified?
- What's the measurable impact?
- What would you do differently?

**üìû If something breaks:**
- **Report immediately** to development team
- **Don't try to fix it yourself**
- **Document what was happening when it broke**
- **Communicate with users** about status

## üîß Quick Reference

**Good Ideas for GSD:**
- Automating manual processes that take hours
- Creating simple dashboards for existing data
- Building forms to replace paper processes
- Connecting systems that don't talk to each other

**Bad Ideas for GSD:**
- "Make everything better" (too vague)
- Completely replacing major systems (too big)
- Personal convenience tools (low public value)
- Ideas requiring policy changes (not a tech problem)

**Success Timeline:**
- **Week 1**: Submit idea, get AI assessment
- **Week 2-3**: Work with development team on planning
- **Week 4-12**: Development and testing
- **Week 13+**: Production launch and support

**Who to Contact:**
- **GSD System**: https://goa-cc-aim-gsd-de-app.azurewebsites.net
- **Questions**: Your ministry's innovation team
- **Technical Issues**: Development team through GSD portal

## ‚ö° TL;DR

1. **Submit specific idea** with clear problem description
2. **Wait for AI assessment**, answer follow-up questions
3. **Work with dev team**, be available and responsive
4. **Test thoroughly** on staging before launch
5. **Support your users** after go-live and measure impact

*If you follow these 5 steps, your government project will probably get built and actually used. If you don't, it won't.*
